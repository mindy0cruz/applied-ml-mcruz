 #  Final Project: Medical cost

 Name: Mindy Cruz

 Date 4/20/2025

## Objective:

Businesses and organizations often need to understand the relationships between different factors to make better decisions. For example, a company may want to predict the fuel efficiency of a car based on its weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location. Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making.

This project demonstrates your ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will:

-Load and explore a dataset.
-Choose and justify features for predicting a target variable.
-Train a regression model and evaluate performance.
-Compare multiple regression approaches.
-Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
-Conduct a peer review of a classmate's project.

__Intoduction:__
- I will be taking the Medical Cost data set and apply regression modeling techniques. Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making.

__Project Setup__

1. Create folder in Github repo for the Final- ML07
2. Downloaded data that was were using for this project. In this case I chose the Medical Cost dataset.
3. After setting up all my files for this project which include the notebook, README.md and peer review. I activated my virtual enviroment by entering the prompt
    - .venv\Scripts\activate
 4. Once confirmed I began my project and saved an pushed often. 
 5. Added PeerReview.md

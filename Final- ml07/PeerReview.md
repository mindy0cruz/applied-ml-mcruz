- Clarity & Organization 
    - Sarah's notebook is well organized and easy to follow.

- Feature Selection & Justification 
    - The chosen features were good choices. I think they are good indicators of MPG.

- Model Performance & Comparisons 
    - The models did a good job of capturing the intended outcome. I did not do this data set but It was interesting to read through the process. 

- Reflection Quality 
    - Great summary and anaylsis of how the project went. She did a good job of talking about what went well and worked the best in reguards to modeling.

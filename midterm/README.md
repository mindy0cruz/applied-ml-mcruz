 # Mushroom Midterm 

## Objective:

This project demonstrates your ability to apply classification modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will:

- Load and explore a dataset.
- Analyze feature distributions and consider feature selection.
- Train and evaluate a classification model.
- Compare different classification approaches.
- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Conduct a peer review of a classmateâ€™s project.

__Intoduction:__

- using the UCI Mushroom Dataset, I will to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.

 # Mushroom Midterm 

 Name: Mindy Cruz

 Date 4/6/2025

## Objective:

This project demonstrates your ability to apply classification modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will:

- Load and explore a dataset.
- Analyze feature distributions and consider feature selection.
- Train and evaluate a classification model.
- Compare different classification approaches.
- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Conduct a peer review of a classmateâ€™s project.

__Intoduction:__

- using the UCI Mushroom Dataset, I will to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.

__Project Setup__

1. Create folder in Github repo for the midterm
2. Downloaded data that was were using for this project. In this case I chose the Mushroom dataset.
3. After setting up all my files for this project which include the notebook, README.md and peer review. I activated my virtual enviroment by entering the prompt
    - .venv\Scripts\activate
 4. Once confirmed I began my project and saved an pushed often. 
 5. Added PeerReview.md

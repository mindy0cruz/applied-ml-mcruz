# Peer Review : Gabriel Richards

[Gabriel's Project](https://github.com/gjrich/mlp4/blob/master/classification_project.ipynb)

- Clarity and Organization: Gabriel did a good job of listing the section headers and subsets. 

- Feature Selection & Justification: I like the features Gabriel selected. Like me, it looks like he chose physical characteristics to investigate. I feel like 
    the use of stacked bar charts to display finds was very effective because we can see poisonous vs edible very easily. 

- Model Performance & Comparisons: I do beleive the Gabriel did good job of displaying the data in a why that lets a user easily compare features. One thing that I 
    beleive would be more helpful is sumarizing the data points that are being compared. Graphs are great but seeing the numbers side by side would make it easier for a reviewer to see the impact this data has. 

- Reflection Quality: This was a very cumbersome project with alot of moving parts. I feel the Gabriel did a good job presenting the data.

    "# Lab 3: Titanic Project- Predicting a Categorical Target and Evaluating Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name: Mindy Cruz\n",
    "### Date: 4/5/2025\n",
    "### Intro: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we use the Titanic dataset to build and evaluate three classifiers: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. We compare model performance across three different feature sets and reflect on their effectiveness for predicting passenger survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three common classification models are listed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree Classifier (DT) - A Decision Tree splits data into smaller groups based on decision rules (like \"is height greater than 150 cm?\"). Itâ€™s like a flowchart, where each decision point leads to another question until a final classification is reached. Easy to interpret and fast to train, but can overfit if the tree becomes too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) - A Support Vector Machine tries to find the \"best boundary\" (a hyperplane) that separates data into classes. It works well with complex data and small datasets. Effective when there is a clear margin of separation between classes, but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Network (NN) - A Neural Network is inspired by how human brains process information. It consists of layers of interconnected \"neurons\" that process input data and adjust based on feedback. It can handle complex patterns and non-linear relationships, but needs more data and tuning to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to classify data, using three (or more) models can help:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees illustrate how individual features contribute to classification.\n",
    "SVMs are good at finding complex boundaries.\n",
    "Neural Networks are good at learning patterns from complex data."
